res.render() wpnt be called anymore because rest api only deals with data
instead we would return a JSON response. using res.json().
you also have to set the status code and make sure you are clear about it. note: 200 is the default.
the client now has to render the user interface based on the response.

it is therefore important send the right status code.

Postman: 
To test data used in rest api.(it is an api development tool)
Go to their website and download postman.

Open postman

Enter the url where your node server runs on e.g if port is 8080, and you want to go to /feed/posts enter http://localhost:8080/feed/posts. then you can choose your http method
if Post choose raw, then in the dropdown choose json.
write the data, then click send to get back the response.

With postman you can easily test ur api endpoints
