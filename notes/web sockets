allows us to build real-time web-services.  we can use a library(socket.io).

to use, it has to be added on both the frontend and the backend. to install run npm install --save socket.io

go to app.js to setup the conection

Also run npm install --save socket.io -client in the frontend code, so that you can connect the server and the client 

socket.io isnt the only library you can use.
