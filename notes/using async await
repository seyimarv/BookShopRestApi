async await:
allows you to write asynchrous requests in a synchronous way. (only by the way it looks, not by the way it behaves).

to handle error using async await you can use try and catch block(usually used for synchrounous code). 

Top-level await:
you can also use await in a top level i.e not in a function


summarry: Mongoose does not return promise but uses a promise-like object.
