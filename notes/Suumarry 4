Rest Api are all about Data, no UI logic is exchanged. REST APIS are normal Node servers which expose diferent endpoints(Http method + path)
for clients to send requests to.

JSON is the common Data format that is used both for requests and responses.
REST APIS are decoupled from the clients that use them.


Requests and Resonses:
attach data in JSON format and let the other end know by setting the "Content-Type" header.
Cors errors occur when using an API that does not set CORS headers.

The Rest Api does not care about the client, requests are handled in isolation => No sessions
